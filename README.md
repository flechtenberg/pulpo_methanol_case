## Repository Structure

This repository supports the CCU case study presented in the manuscript "**PULPO: A framework for efficient integration of life cycle inventory models into life cycle product optimization**" published in the *Journal of Industrial Ecology*. It is structured as follows:

### Code Folder
This folder contains all the necessary notebooks and input data to reproduce the case study. This involves:
- Generating the necessary inputs from premise.
- Installing premise databases.
- Adapting them to the production system of the case study (including CO2 capture, etc.).
- Running the optimization in the base and full abatement cases.
- Assessing burden shifting using other indicators.

Refer to the readme of the folder ("[readme_code.md](Code/readme_code.md)
") for details on each and every file contained in this folder.

### Figures Folder
This folder contains all the notebooks used to create the figures of the manuscript, using the outputs generated from the **Code Folder** in combination with a few additional inputs. Refer to the readme of the folder ("[readme_figures.md](Figures/readme_figures.md)") for details on each and every file contained in this folder.

### Main Folder
The main folder contains the numeric data that underlies every figure in the manuscript. Below is a brief explanation of each file:

#### Figures 4
- **Figure_4_Base.csv**
- **Figure_4_NDC.csv**
- **Figure_4_PkBudg500.csv**
  - **Description**: For a given epsilon, these files contain the quantities of methanol produced with PSC, DAC, BAU, and the necessary additional electricity.
  - **Columns**: `Epsilon [-]`, `PSC [Mt]`, `DAC [Mt]`, `BAU [Mt]`, `Electricity [TWh]`

#### Figures 5
- **Figure_5_2030.csv**
- **Figure_5_2040.csv**
- **Figure_5_2050.csv**
  - **Description**: For the different years (noted by the year in the file title), these files contain the optimal production quantities by technology in each region.
  - **Rows**: Regions
  - **Columns**: `PSC`, `DAC`, `Total CCU meoh production`

#### Figure 6
- **Figure_6.csv**
  - **Description**: Contains data for each demand, for each region indicating the employed tech and production values with PSC, DAC, or BAU.
  - **Columns**: `scenario`, `year`, `epsilon [%]`, `demand [Mt]`, `region`, `tech`, `meoh [Mt]`, `elec [TWh]`, `net-zero GWP [Mt]`, `GWP reduction [Mt]`

#### Figures S1
- **Figure_S1.csv**
- **Figure_S1_constraints.csv**
- **Figure_S1_optima.csv**
  - **Description**: Hypothetical data for the indication of the objective function values, the constraints, and the two optima (constrained and unconstrained).

#### Figures S3
- **Figure_S3_biosphere.csv**
- **Figure_S3_outcomes.csv**
- **Figure_S3_technosphere.csv**
  - **Description**: Data for the bar charts, comparing optimized and non-optimized impacts, technosphere, and biosphere flows.

#### Figures S7
- **Figure_S7_Base.csv**
- **Figure_S7_NDC.csv**
- **Figure_S7_PkBudg500.csv**
  - **Description**: Contains the electricity production technologies for each scenario as indicated by the filename.
  - **Rows**: Years
  - **Columns**: Electricity production technologies

#### Figures S8
- **Figure_S8_additional_electricity.csv**
  - **Description**: Contains the total electricity values and the corresponding epsilon values for each scenario.
  - **Columns**: Scenarios
  - **Rows**: Total electricity values and the corresponding epsilon values

- **Figure_S8_electricity_mix.csv**
  - **Description**: Contains the electricity production technologies as a result of the optimization (in TWh) for the full abatement case.
  - **Columns**: Scenarios
  - **Rows**: Electricity production technologies

- **Figure_S8_meoh_production.csv**
  - **Description**: Contains the methanol production technologies (BAU, PSC, and DAC) for the full abatement case.
  - **Columns**: Scenarios (Base, NDC, PkBudg500)
  - **Rows**: Meoh production technologies
  
Additionally, there is an **[abbreviations.md](abbreviations.md)** file (TBD) which contains all the metadata and abbreviations used within the data and notebooks.

### ü§ñ Running pulpo_methanol_case
To run the assessments you may create a new conda environment e.g. "*pulpo_methanol_case*" and install the requirements:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

One of the requirements is to have the [PULPO](https://github.com/flechtenberg/pulpo) package installed (for this version, use v0.0.4 of PULPO).
